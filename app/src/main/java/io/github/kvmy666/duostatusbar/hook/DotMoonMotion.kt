/**
 * Eases a signal dot into the white Do Not Disturb crescent.
 *
 * The settled snapshot is instant: a weak bar is the gray circle, a strong bar is the white moon,
 * and a fully hidden row (airplane mode, Wi-Fi off) is the one moon in the middle of that row.
 * The status-bar views call [push] on each snapshot and, while [running], once a frame, so the
 * circle fades as the crescent grows into its place. The first snapshot snaps, so attaching the
 * element does not play a fill.
 *
 * Only those opacities move. The rest of the snapshot (the ring, the middle slot, the percentage)
 * is taken from the newest target, so a battery change during a fill does not lag or restart it.
