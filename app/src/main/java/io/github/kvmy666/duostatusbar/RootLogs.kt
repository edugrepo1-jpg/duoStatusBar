/**
 * App-side diagnostics capture that works on **every** root method and on none at all.
 *
 * The old capture ran a single `su -c …` and, when that failed (no `su` on `PATH`, or SELinux denying the
 * app), returned an error and left the report with nothing. That is why most user reports arrived as a
 * few hundred bytes (measured: `Cannot run program "su": error=2` / `error=13`). The module's own log is
 * pushed without root, but on a device where the module never loaded even that is absent, so the report
 * had no evidence at all.
 *
 * This capture is now multi-route and never makes one route's failure the whole report's failure:
 *
 *   1. **Root** — only after the user taps *Allow root access* (an explicit `su -c id`). Reads the
 *      filtered logcat and LSPosed's own log (`/data/adb/lspd/log`), the sink that survives OEM log
 *      filtering. This is the only route that can read LSPosed's file, so it stays the best one.
 *   2. **Shizuku / Sui** — a binder, not a binary, so it works regardless of how the phone is rooted (and
 *      on a non-rooted phone started over adb). Runs the same tag-filtered commands as shell.
 *   3. **Module log** — already delivered by the module through the settings channel, no privilege needed.
 *   4. **Device facts** — always appended, so a report is never empty.
 *
 * Every command is filtered to this module (`-s DuoSB`, `grep duostatusbar`); a full logcat is never
 * captured, so no other app's data can leak into a report.
 *
 * [RootProbe] decides which route is available from measured facts; this object only gathers them.
