/**
 * What a ROM is called and where its status-bar icon strip lives (FR-01/02).
 *
 * The project's rule is that nothing ROM-specific is guessed: every id here is either **measured on a
 * device** or explicitly marked unverified, and [RomAdapter.notes] says which. The runtime additionally
 * logs every id it probes and what it found (`container <name> -> <class or null>`), so an unsupported ROM
 * produces evidence to add an adapter from — not silence.
 *
 * The AOSP spelling comes first in every list on purpose: it is the name the module targets, and a ROM that
 * keeps it works without a ROM-specific entry at all.
