/**
 * The Duo element (the real one), drawn by Rive inside the SystemUI process.
 *
 * `RiveAnimationView` is embedded in a `FrameLayout` so the status-bar side owns the bounds while Rive
 * owns the drawing. The builder is used instead of `setRiveBytes` for one non-negotiable reason: the
 * **renderer type must be explicit**. `RiveAnimationView` is a `TextureView`-based surface, and leaving
 * the type unset makes the runtime read `Rive.defaultRendererType` — the static that `Rive.init` fails
 * to assign inside SystemUI, and the null that segfaulted the first Phase 3 attempt (see [RiveInit]).
 * Passing `RendererType.Canvas` means the type cannot be null whatever that static holds.
 *
 * `Fit.CONTAIN` keeps the element square whatever shape the ROM's slot is: the measured slot is 83x61 px,
 * so the ring scales to the 61 px height and centres, instead of being stretched into an oval.
 *
 * Every step is guarded: if anything here fails the stock status bar stays exactly as it was (FR-21).
